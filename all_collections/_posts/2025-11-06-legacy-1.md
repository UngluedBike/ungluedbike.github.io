So in line with my first post, this is a quick overview of one of my earlier projects from around 2021. At that time I was still using a tool called WaniKani to learn kanji (please don't use this if you are interested in japanese, themoeway or refold are much better methods!). While doing so I discovered a wonderful little tool for iOS that created a wallpaper of your progress, made by [maboesanman](https://github.com/maboesanman). Unfortunately I was (and still am!) a fairly die hard Android user at that point, and scriptable was iOS only. So I decided to port it to android using a different app called tasker!

<div style="display: flex; gap: 10px; flex-wrap: wrap;">
  <img src="/assets/img/example_buffer.png" alt="Buffer" style="width:48%; max-width:100%;">
  <img src="/assets/img/example_nobuffer.png" alt="No buffer" style="width:48%; max-width:100%;">
</div>

While I was able to use the existing api data and caching code for the most part, the drawing code had to be remade from scratch using the html canvas system, which was a pain to research thanks to tasker's not so great docs. I added a couple of features not present in the original project, such as customisable borders/buffers to account for the unusual shapes of some android screens (my oneplus at the time had curved edges so it was hard to see the edge characters), and the ability to set just one wallpaper instead of both. All in all, a nice short project that was a lot of fun, and I got something that I was able to use daily for some time after (until I quit WK...). The code can be found [here](https://github.com/UngluedBike/WKWallpaperAndroid/), but I imagine it will need some updates to work again. An exercise left to the reader....
