Hi, I'm ungluedbike (often just bike), and this is my little blog for posting about cool stuff I make and do. Making this is well overdue, so initially I'm gonna make a few posts
about notable things I've worked on in the past and then eventually a post about my current, yet to be released project ;)

My interests include gaming (mainly shooters and rhythm games), anime, learning Japanese, hiking and making cool stuff with code. Many of my projects tend to relate to these things.
